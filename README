//program to keep track of steam games that require windows
//Linux NTFS driver(s) and however the hell steam runs its updates seems to cause corruption for some games (Modern COD games) when allowing steam under a linux distro to directly manage games on an NTFS drives
//Keeping games managed by the windows steam means that when your friends want to play warzone, its very likely that cod isn't updated
//mounting the ntfs partition as readonly causes issues where steam wants to compile shaders

GOALS:

//Keep List of games that a user would like to use Windows to play
//Store these on the User's least needed drive
    //have linux update them
    //when updates are complete, mount the NTFS drive and copy the game directly
//trackworkshopfiles as well
//Have a steam compatibility tool that uses grub-reboot to reboot to windows

//idea: steam cleanup ubertool to track unused wineprefixes
//renamem to "LGBF"

//optional - integrated bluetooth syncing for controllers between Windows and Linux
